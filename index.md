### SAO

## Kazuto Kirigaya AKA-(Kirito)
Kirito is someone who is not good with words, as stated by Klein, and can be quite direct. This is due to him not having many friends and closing others off because of his love for computers. As such, he can come off as a rude person to others, such as Lisbeth and Sinon. Sometimes, he actually seems to enjoy angering and teasing people as well. Also, from time to time, Kirito can be quite overconfident thinking he can do things others cannot.

He is almost always a calm and collected character, rarely showing any signs of distress. When Kayaba Akihiko appeared in SAO and announced that it had become a Death Game, Kirito showed only a slight reaction and was able to quickly accept the new conditions of the game, while many others panicked. He has shown different moods throughout the series; at times being rather cheerful, while being gloomy at others. When in a battle, he becomes incredibly fierce and aggressive. Sometimes, his fierceness is up to the point where he loses control of himself and is even unable to recall what he had done.

However, Kirito is actually a kind person who is just misunderstood. Despite the general population opinion towards beta testers in SAO, he refused to abandon another player in trouble, especially after the demise of the Moonlit Black Cats. He also comforts others who are scared or down such as Silica after she lost Pina. He claims to help a female player in SAO because she reminds him of his sister, whom he feels to have forced into kendo and feels guilty for that. These kinds of acts have earned him respect and affection from many girls. Kirito, unlike usual male heroes, is not very dense as he was able to tell that Lisbeth was going to confess to him before Asuna interrupted them.

Kirito is also a very emotional person and lets his emotions control him from time to time. The deaths of Sachi and the Moonlit Black Cats had haunted him until his marriage with Asuna in Sword Art Online. Sachi's death, in particular, had a huge effect on his personality and motives, making him very distant from others for a while. This worries his friends and allies as Kirito is someone who would let guilt ruin his life if not comforted. Kirito temporarily loses his will to live when Asuna's character was killed by Heathcliff. He also tries to hide his abilities, not wanting unneeded attention.

Kirito is a person with incredibly strong resolve who will do anything and everything in his power to accomplish something that is important to him without any hesitation. When Asuna was being held in ALfheim, Kirito was bound and determined to set her free and, when Yui confirmed that she detected Asuna being at the top of the World Tree, he immediately tried to fly up to the tree, which had already been found to be an impossible task, and tried to fight his way to the top by himself twice despite being annihilated the first time.

After escaping SAO, Kirito attempts to repair his relationship with Suguha, his cousin. This shows Kirito is now attempting to make up for his past mistake of ignoring her, showing a sense of maturity. Kirito, later in the series, is shown to be a calm and mature player who can be teasing as well.

Asuna originally did not care about dying in the game before meeting Kirito. That meeting drastically changed Asuna's personality and outlook on life. She soon takes most things Kirito says to heart and looks to him for help, using him as somewhat of a lifeline.

Asuna is a kind and helpful young woman who, similarly to Kirito, cannot abandon another in trouble. She takes the game very seriously and is determined to clear it before Kirito tells her to enjoy SAO a bit. Asuna is also somewhat proud and despite her kind personality, she will not hesitate to get physical with those that challenge her authority or make fun of her abilities, such as cooking. She even challenged Kirito to a duel after an argument over how to handle a Field Boss. She is not afraid to act out on her own and will take matters into her own hands from time to time.

Asuna, in a similar manner to Kirito, is someone who can be controlled and manipulated by her emotions. This is evident during Kirito's final duel with Heathcliff on the 75th Floor, when she resisted her paralysis, jumped in front of Kirito, and took an attack that would have otherwise killed him. She also cannot handle seeing others die in front of her, such as when she recklessly attacked The Gleam Eyes after seeing the Aincrad Liberation Force players getting slaughtered.

In ALO, after being saved by Kirito, Asuna's personality had not changed a bit except that she was not as proud as she was in SAO. Her personality began to develop further still after meeting Yuuki in the events of Mother's Rosario. Seeing how Yuuki still moves forward, despite knowing her death is inevitable, Asuna takes after her and resolves to keep moving forward, no matter what happens.
## Ayano Keiko AKA-(silica)
Silica is very kind, bright, cheerful, and supportive of her friends.[citation needed] She also has developed a deep attachment to her Tamed Monster Pina to the point that she was heartbroken to see it die and overjoyed when told that there was a way to revive it.

At some point, Silica had become arrogant due to her fame, but realised her mistake after this led to her getting lost in the Forest of Wandering and losing Pina.

Silica is also easily embarrassed and flustered, especially when it comes to a romance scenario, such as grabbing Kirito's hand, spotting many couples around her, or having her skirt flipped by a monster.
## Tsuboi Ryoutarou AKA-(klein)
Klein is one of the friendliest people in the series and sets the mood when he is around. He never holds grudges against others and is always ready to lend a helping hand. He cares deeply for his friends and always wants to be by their side fighting alongside them when they are in danger even to the point of getting angry when Kirito was fighting Death Gun, saying he should have converted to Gun Gale Online as well. He gets angry when people get into situations that can get them killed since he wants to protect as many people as he can.[citation needed]

Klein is a very loyal person, which is apparent in his friendship with Kirito, despite the latter usually treating him with coldness.[citation needed] Klein is also a "bachelor" and is shown trying to get together with various women in the series, such as Asuna, Freyja, and even Kazuto's sister, whom he had yet to meet.
## Shinozaki Rika AKA-(Lizbeth)
Lisbeth is a very friendly person that can get along with just about everyone she meets. She is hardworking and takes great pride in her abilities as a blacksmith. She will become very defensive and aggressive if someone were to challenge her pride as a blacksmith much like Kirito did after accidentally breaking the best sword she had created. She has a bad temper and can get somewhat violent, such as when she grabbed Kirito by the collar after he broke one of her best swords. Lisbeth is very teasing as well.
## Andrew Gilbert Mills AKA-(Agil)
Agil is a friendly and very helpful person who is always looking out for others. He is also someone to rely on such as when he defended the beta testers against Kibaou, giving Kirito a place to stay, and helping players on lower floors. He also can be a leader on the battlefield and will help his comrades and friends no matter what the cost may be. Although he acted as if he only cared about the money, Kirito commented that Agil had spent all of his money helping mid-level players level up.
## Sachi
Sachi was a timid, apprehensive girl, who feared dying in Sword Art Online. Due to this fear, she had never intended to leave the Town of Beginnings and hated going into battles.[7] She only felt the peace of mind to sleep soundly when she discovered Kirito's true level, which made her feel safe in his presence.[7]
## Kayaba Akihiko AKA-(heatcliff)
Although Kayaba Akihiko appeared as his true form only a few times throughout the series, he was always very calm, soft-spoken, and had a cool demeanor. Despite being incredibly skilled, Akihiko was not boastful or arrogant, as when Kirito defeated him and cleared Sword Art Online, he humbly accepted defeat.

Akihiko seemed to be very sincere and thoughtful, as shown when he told Kirito of his dream about creating a floating castle as the basis for creating Sword Art Online.

Kayaba Akihiko had little to no empathy, with a complete disregard for human life, including his own, and instead was completely taken in by the virtual world. When he accidentally struck Asuna, which caused her apparent in-game death, he showed no remorse, and instead seemed rather amused, even though it caused Kirito an incredible amount of grief at the time. He chose to fulfill his dream by making a death game which cost thousands of lives, and simply noted that their minds were gone from both worlds. His fascination with computers was very much like Kirito's, with the major difference being Akihiko having no regard for the lives of others, and Kirito doing everything he can to protect them.

In spite of this, Akihiko had a level of honor and fairness. He designed Sword Art Online to be a beatable game by anyone who had the skills. He never interfered with the players' progress to keep them from advancing through the game; in fact, as Heathcliff, he was actually fighting on the players' side, helping them clear floors. The one exception to this was the fact that he made himself invincible until his battle with Kirito, although this was necessary to survive the game until the 95th floor was reached, where Heathcliff planned to reveal his true identity and become the final boss on the 100th floor.

### ALO
## Kirigaya Suguha AKA-(lefa) 
Unlike her cousin Kazuto, Suguha is upbeat and outgoing. She is much more social and converses easily with others. Even when Kazuto began to push her away after finding out they were not really siblings, she still treated him with good spirit and tried to get back in his life. She can be very aggressive towards those that annoy her or cross her and can easily lose her temper. This is demonstrated in one case when Recon attempted to kiss her after confessing his love to her and she punched him.

Despite her positive outlook and slightly aggressive behavior, Suguha can be somewhat fragile and delicate due to her young age, especially when her cousin, Kazuto is involved. After seeing Kazuto in a comatose state due to being locked in SAO, she broke down crying for the first time in years. In addition to this, once she found out that Kirito and Kazuto were the same person, she locked herself in her room away from her cousin and went into a slight depression. Most of the time she is quick to rebound from these moments and return to being the same upbeat girl.
## Alicia Rue
Alicia Rue (アリシャ・ルー, Arisha Rū?) is the Lord of the Cait Sith race in «ALfheim Online» (ALO). She was elected to the position of leader by popular vote. She formed an alliance with the Sylphs to finish the «Guardians of the World Tree».
## Sakuya
(サクヤ, Sakuya?) is the Lord of the Sylph race in ALfheim Online and an exceptional swordswoman. She was elected as the leader of the Sylph race by popular vote (80% voice of the vote[2]). Her statistics are not very high due to her status as a Lord not allowing her to do much training. Despite her low stats, she is a formidable opponent in the Sylph dueling tournaments.
## Eugene
During Eugene's duel with Kirito it was revealed that Eugene is interested in fighting strong opponents, as, after Kirito withstood thirty seconds in battle with him, Eugene claimed that he changed the plan to have their duel changed to a deathmatch as he really wanted to cut Kirito down.
## Sugou Nobuyuki AKA-(Oberon)
Nobuyuki hides his true personality, especially in front of Asuna's father but shows his true colors to Kazuto as soon as they were left alone. Nobuyuki is an amoral and greedy entrepreneur, having kidnapped 300 players from SAO for his experiment on manipulating the human mind, which he planned to sell to other companies. Nobuyuki also has a habit of framing others for his problems, especially Kayaba as he felt that he was the source of all of his problems.

Nobuyuki also viewed himself as a god that could get anything he wanted, viewing other people as inferiors who tried to interfere with his actions, and often abused his GM status to flaunt his "god"-like status. Nobuyuki also harmed many people, especially their feelings, and thought that they were helpless to do anything about it. He also has an extremely perverted side, especially towards Asuna, as he had sexually harassed her on many occasions, even going as far abusing her in front of Kirito.

Unlike Akihiko, however, Nobuyuki is a poor fighter, as when he tried to attack Kirito after the latter had given him the strongest weapon in ALO, Kirito parried with ease. Nobuyuki also has low tolerance for pain; even a slice on the cheek was enough to make him panic.
## 
### GGO
## Asada Shino AKA-(sinon)
Calm and cool are two words that best describe Sinon's personality. In battle and most of the time in the game, she keeps a cool head, which earns her respect from her friends. However, Sinon has a violent temper once angered, best seen with her interactions with Kirito. It is actually said that Kirito is the first one to make her extremely angry.[citation needed] Despite all this, Sinon, while perhaps hard to approach, is generally a friendly person and does not mind helping others.[citation needed]

Shino, however, can be a fragile-minded character. This is due to her childhood incident that involved her killing a robber. If someone were to act as if they were shooting her in real life Shino would have a nervous breakdown and be on the verge of collapsing. People have used this to take advantage of Shino before. Not only this, but the guilt of taking another's life haunts Shino the same way killing Laughing Coffin members haunts Kazuto. After the Death Gun Incident, Shino has made progress with handling her trauma, as she did not have any serious reactions to seeing a model gun when Endou threatened to shoot her with one, and was even able to use it while feigning that she was not affected by it.

Shino is shown to have an uncommonly kind heart. Not only was she willing to forgive Shinkawa Kyouji, but still cared for him as a friend to the extent that she resolved to visit him in prison to try and help, if not save him as a person.
## Shinkawa Shouichi AKA-(Deathgun)
Shouichi is a cold and sadistic person who believed in PoH's principles, thus he enjoys killing other players, even with full knowledge that they would be killed in real life as well. It was later revealed that Shouichi enjoyed killing other players because he enjoyed the feeling of being feared by others.[1]

As Shouichi's father did not have any expectations for him due to him being frail and sick, Shouichi eventually dropped out of high school and turned to the Internet as his haven and started playing MMORPGs until he was trapped in SAO, where he committed various crimes, became a Player Killer one year after the game started, and joined Laughing Coffin. Shouichi's sense of reality had been wearing thin since then, feeling that only things beneficial to him were real.

After the death game had ended, Shouichi took his brother's Kyouji's advice and started playing Gun Gale Online. Shouichi spent time on the streets observing other players and imagining ways of killing them. While playing Gun Gale Online under the advice of his brother Kyouji, Shouichi did not battle monsters, but instead observed other players while thinking of ways to kill them. After obtaining his camouflage mantle, he practiced ways of obscuring himself from others, feeling that it was interesting to tail someone from behind. After he managed to find out the real life addresses of several players by tailing them when they inputted their personal information in the presidential estate of SBC Glocken, he and his brother came up with a plot to continue killing people in the real world, supposedly via the use of a «Death Gun» in-game.

Shouichi has an amazing memory, as he was able to remember players' addresses and then write them down when he logged off.
## Shinkawa Kyouji
On November 9, 2025, Kyouji logged into Gun Gale Online as Sterben, his brother's avatar, to watch XeXeeD's appearance on MMO Stream's This Week's Winners program from a bar in SBC Glocken. Quietly incensed at XeXeeD's mocking of GGO players with agility-focused avatars, Sterben restrained himself for a few minutes before walking directly under the pub's holo-panel broadcasting the channel. Having withdrawn a Type 54 "Black Star" from its holster, loaded the gun, and pointed it at the screen, he condemned XeXeeD for his actions and declared he would judge him with his true power. At exactly 11:30:02, having performed the sign of the cross, he fired the handgun at XeXeeD's image on the holo-TV. When XeXeeD abruptly disconnected thirteen seconds later, Sterben proclaimed this was a demonstration of true strength and true power, naming himself and his weapon as Death Gun, before logging off in triumph.

A month later, Kyouji saved Shino from Endou and her group of bullies who wanted her to withdraw money for them from an ATM on her way home. He scared them off by pretending to be bringing a police officer to the scene. Later, he brought Shino to a cafe and there, he offered to be Shino's protector by accompanying her from school everyday. Shino declined, but thanked him before parting ways.

After the Bullet of Bullet (BoB) tournament was concluded, Kyouji went over to Shino's apartment to congratulate her. During their conversation, Kyouji mentioned the scene at the desert cave and asked whether she was threatened by Kirito then asked to confirm that she had no feelings for him. Kyouji then confessed his love to her, but Shino nudged Kyouji away from herself.

Shocked by Shino's actions, Kyouji claimed that only he could save her and she could not be attracted to other men. Kyouji then took out a needless syringe from his jacket and placed it on Shino's neck, warning her not to move or scream. He revealed his plan to slowly inject a drug that would paralyse her muscles, causing her heart to stop. This made Shino recall the Death Gun plot, thus she asked whether Kyouji was a part of it. The amazed Kyouji confirmed this and revealed he was the one who shot XeXeeD in-game but would not allow anyone, including his brother, to touch her, thus he chose to be active in the real world on this occasion.

Before Kyouji could kill her, Shino used an opportunity to grab the cylinder of the syringe. Shino attempted to pull the syringe out of Kyouji's hands but failed. After being punched in the shoulder, Shino hit her writing desk with her back and one of the drawers opened, with its contents scattering on the ground. While trying to get up, Shino realised that she had touched the model Procyon SL gun that she had won from the previous BoB tournament. Shino grabbed the gun and pointed it and Kyouji, tricking him into believing that she could kill him with it.

While Kyouji showed no signs of consciousness, Shino ran to the door and unlocked it, but Kyouji recovered, grabbed her ankle and pulled her back. Just then, Kirigaya Kazuto ran into the apartment and kicked Kyouji. During their struggle, Kyouji managed to punch Kazuto in the face, then took out his syringe and seemingly injected it into Kazuto's chest. Several moments later, Shino swung her stereo at Kyouji's head, knocking him out.

During Kazuto and Shino's conversation with Kikuoka Seijirou several days later, the Death Gun incident was summarised. Kyouji, along with his brother, Shinkawa Shouichi, and another Laughing Coffin member, Kanamoto Atsushi (Johnny Black), planned to kill players in the real world, allegedly by killing them in the virtual world. As nobody believed in the deaths of XeXeeD and Usujio Tarako, his brother entered the Bullet of Bullets tournament under the name «Sterben» to make the rest of the world believe in their supposed killing ability, while in reality, Kyouji and Atsushi would inject the players in the real world with a syringe filled with succinylcholine, which stopped the heart. They had obtained the address by watching players type in their real addresses, while hiding under a «Metamaterial Optical Camouflage mantle», during the BoB registration process.

### the Story
## Warning this will have spoilers to the SAO series for those who haent seen the other episodes or first timers.
In 2022, a virtual reality massively multiplayer online role-playing game (VRMMORPG) called Sword Art Online (SAO) is released. With the NerveGear, a helmet that stimulates the user's five senses via their brain, players can experience and control their in-game characters with their minds. Both the game and the NerveGear were created by Akihiko Kayaba.

On November 6, 10,000 players log into the SAO's mainframe cyberspace for the first time, only to discover that they are unable to log out. Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO, if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.

One of the players, named Kazuto "Kirito" Kirigaya, is one of 1,000 testers in the game's previous closed beta. With the advantage of previous VR gaming experience and a drive to protect other beta testers from discrimination, he isolates himself from the greater groups and plays the game alone, bearing the mantle of "beater", a portmanteau of "beta tester" and "cheater". As the players progress through the game Kirito eventually befriends a young girl named Asuna Yuuki, forming a relationship with and later marrying her in-game. After the duo discover the identity of Kayaba's secret ID, who was playing as the leader of the guild Asuna joined in, they confront and destroy him, freeing themselves and the other players from the game.

In the real world, Kazuto discovers that 300 SAO players, including Asuna, remain trapped in their NerveGear. As he goes to the hospital to see Asuna, he meets Shouzou Yuuki, Asuna's father, who is asked by an associate of his, Nobuyuki Sugou, to make a decision, which Sugou later reveals to be his marriage with Asuna, angering Kazuto. Several months later, he is informed by Agil, another SAO survivor, that a figure similar to Asuna was spotted on "The World Tree" in another VRMMORPG cyberspace called Alfheim Online (ALO). Assisted in-game by his cousin Suguha "Leafa" Kirigaya and Yui, a navigation pixie (originally an AI from SAO), he quickly learns that the trapped players in ALO are part of a plan conceived by Sugou to perform illegal experiments on their minds. The goal is to create the perfect mind-control for financial gain and to subjugate Asuna, whom he intends to marry in the real world, to assume control of her family's corporation. Kirito eventually stops the experiment and rescues the remaining 300 SAO players, foiling Sugou's plans. Before leaving ALO to see Asuna, Kayaba, who has uploaded his mind to the Internet using an experimental and destructively high-power version of NerveGear at the cost of his life, entrusts Kirito with The Seed – a package program designed to create virtual worlds. Kazuto eventually reunites with Asuna in the real world and The Seed is released onto the Internet, reviving Aincrad as other VRMMORPGs begin to thrive.

Soon after, at the prompting of a government official investigating strange occurrences in VR, Kazuto takes on a job to investigate a series of murders involving another VRMMORPG called Gun Gale Online (GGO), the AmuSphere (the successor of the NerveGear), and a player called Death Gun. Aided by a female player named Shino "Sinon" Asada, he participates in a gunfight tournament called the Bullet of Bullets (BoB) and discovers the truth behind the murders, which originated with a player who participated in a player-killing guild in SAO. Through his and Sinon's efforts, two suspects are captured, though the third suspect, Johnny Black, escapes.

Kazuto is later recruited to assist in testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the Ministry of Defense (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride. The MOD recovers Kazuto and places him back into the STL to preserve his mind while attempts are made to save him.
